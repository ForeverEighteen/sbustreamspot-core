# Evaluate Chunked Shingling for Clustering

This experiment evaluates the influence of chunked shingling on graph clustering.

## Quickstart

   * Run the experiment: `python chunked_shingling_evaluation.py`
   * k-medoids code is from [here](https://github.com/alexprengere/medoids).

## Procedure

   * For different values of chunk length `C`, compute the pairwise similarity
     between all 600 graphs in the UIC data.

   * Run k-medoids clustering (with `k=6`) with the pairwise similarities as
     input.

   * Measure the cluster purity for each value of `C`.

Note that k-medoids is initialized randomly, so YMMV. The provided code
seeds the random number generator so that results are consistent across runs.

## Results

   * Having a large chunk length is equivalent to non-chunked clustering.
   * Having smaller chunk lengths does seem to improve cluster purity.
   * The influence is not predictable (yet); we can see the cluster purity
     both increases and decreases as `C` is increased. 

Note that labels 0 - 4 are the first 5 UIC scenarios, and label 5 is the
attack scenario. The end-goal is to isolate this scenario.
